Installation
============

Currently, the best way to install ``eigenspectra`` is to clone the repo from
GitHub

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/multidworlds/eigenspectra.git

Then run the setup install script

.. code-block:: bash

    cd eigenspectra
    python setup.py install

Developers and collaborators may wish to fork the repo and/or install using
"develop" so that code changes go into effect immediately:

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py develop
